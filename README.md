# Habit Tracker Class
Project 9 of 10 in the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree

The project did not include the creation of a full running application with a user interface. Instead, it was to go through the setup of a SQLite database where daily habits and their attributes are tracked by inputing them into a SQLite database. This project consists of the creating of the setup classes and a demonstration of adding, modifying, and deleting these attributes.
